1. Takes microservice name and page size as input.
2. Microservice when initially deployed will connect to amber using amber - URL/username/password. Where as on widget level if one wants to forcedly cut down the connection to amber we can just click on disconnect or if the amber credentials are changed then for first time we can connect from widget level and microservice will hold the value.
